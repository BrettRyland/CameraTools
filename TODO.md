### TODO
- Add wiki with mouse control info https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/201063-camera-tools-continued-v1150/&do=findComment&comment=4077185
- Allow world-based coordinates for the pathing camera
	- Geo-spatial pathing mode for pathing between GPS coordinates
- In chase plane mode, add an option to pick the part to follow instead of CoM / cockpit.
- Ping "HB Stratos" on Scott's discord when done.
- Add controller support.
	- Buttons should already be mappable as keybinds, but it would be better to have controller buttons in addition to keyboard keys.
	- Input.GetAxis should be able to grab the axes (use velocity mode for these).

### Bugs

### Ideas
- Add the ability to use the stationary and pathing modes in the Editor.
