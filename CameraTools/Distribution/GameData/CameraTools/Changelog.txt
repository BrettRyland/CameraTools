v1.19.1
Bugfixes:
 - Fix random mode transitions that got broken in the last release.
 - Delay activating the new camera mode on vessel switches until LateUpdate for all camera modes, not just dogfight mode.
 - Reset the zoom slider when resetting the FOV.
 - Auto-switch the auto-zoom to regular zoom when entering pathing mode as pathing only uses the regular zoom.
 - Remove the temporaryRevert code (I think that was a Scott Manley hack).

v1.19.0
Improvements:
 - Use a more stable direction for dogfight mode when the vessel is bobbing around on the ocean.
 - Auto-Enable for BDArmory when using surface AIs too.
 - Interpolation rate setting renamed to 'Secondary Smoothing', which takes values in the linear range from 0 to 1 to try to give the user a more intuitive understanding of what the setting does. Actual Lerp values are calculated as 10 ^ {-2 * secondary smoothing} (i.e., 1 to 0.01). Old paths are automatically upgraded to use the new variable.
 - The default hotkey for toggling the menu is now [0] (keypad 0) to avoid a conflict with the new AI GUI in BDArmory, which uses [/].
 - A variety of QoL improvements for pathing mode by HatBat:
	- Keys created during path playback are now automatically inserted at the current path time. Useful for molding paths in to specific shapes.
	- Added a 'Maintain Speed' button to the keyframe editor that adjusts the duration of the current keyframe to approximately match the speed between the previous two keyframes. Useful for smoothly extending paths and correcting speed inconsistencies in complex paths.
	- Camera updates can now be switched between Update or 'Real-time' and FixedUpdate or 'In-Game Time'. 'Real-time' creates smoother paths and works while the game is paused, which helps to reduce lag, while 'In-Game Time' is useful for making sure pathing speed is consistent with game physics and that none of the path is skipped when processing footage to remove lag. See FFmpeg's mpdecimate.
	- New keyframes created while CameraTools is inactive are now correctly started at the current camera position, rather than on top of the vessel facing down or inside the vessel, and use the stock zoom.
	- Path playback now starts from the selected keyframe if one is selected. Useful for previewing small changes to long paths.
	- The flight camera now correctly reverts to its original distance, orientation, zoom state and mode when pathing is deactivated.
	- Camera zoom is now updated immediately rather than gradually when selecting a keyframe or starting a path.
	- [7]/[1] now moves the pathing camera up/down relative to the frame instead of the ground. This functionality was previously on the scroll wheel.
	- Vertical movement with the mouse is now triggered by holding both the middle and left mouse buttons and moving the mouse forward/backward (replaces the previous scroll wheel functionality).
	- Holding keypad Enter (configurable) modifies the reference frame for movement to be relative to the vessel instead of the camera. Also, left/right and forward/backward are reversed for more natural movement when viewing the vessel from the front, which is the typical use-case.
	- The scroll wheel now adjusts the move speed while the pathing camera is active. This is useful for quickly switching between fine adjustments and repositioning of the camera.
	- The default time increment for new keys has been changed back to 10 seconds from 1 second. This is a more practical default path length and makes manually inserting new keys easier.
	- The default rotation interpolation mode is now CubicSpline, was previously Slerp.
	- The last path you used is now remembered between restarts.
	- The GUI no longer closes on pressing save. Replaced by a bit of visual feedback. Useful for habitual save pressers.

v1.18.2:
Improvements:
 - Re-add the "interpolation rate" parameter in pathing. (A value of 1 means that the camera follows the defined path precisely. A value less than 1 means that the camera chases the point on the path.)

v1.18.1:
Improvements:
 - Add customisable min/max values to the keypad move and zoom speeds (editable in the settings.cfg).

v1.18.0:
Improvements:
 - Add option for text input fields instead of sliders.
 - Add 'Maintain Vel.' option, which is the equivalent of the old 'Initial Velocity' reference mode.
 - Make the menu toggle hotkey configurable too.
 - Make loading of paths a bit more fault tolerant.

v1.17.0
Bugfixes:
 - Only activate the camera when changing modes if it was already active.
 - Don't automatically start playing a path when adjusting it or creating a new one and stop it if keyframes or the path is deleted.
 - Start playing a path when it's loaded if camera tools is active.
 - Adjust ordering of stationary path updates to avoid jitter.
Improvements:
 - Automatically disable TimeControl's camera zoom fix as it breaks CameraTools when slow-mo is enabled (sorry @ntwest).
 - Switch stationary and pathing cameras to run in Update instead of FixedUpdate as they aren't sensitive to physics updates.
 - Switch pathing camera to use unscaled time so that it works while paused.
 - Add option of cubic spline interpolation to pathing mode positions based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline#Interpolation_on_an_arbitrary_interval.
 - Add option of Slerp and cubic spline interpolation to pathing mode rotations.
 	- Note: the interpolation method is used from the keypoint it's set in until the next one, so different parts of the path can use different interpolation methods.
 - Rework stationary camera to actually make the camera stationary when below maxRelV. Jumps due to CoM changes (e.g., launch clamp detachment) should not affect the camera position unless maxRelV is extremely low (e.g., <1 in most cases).
 - Option to save the previously used rotation in stationary camera mode when no target is selected (prevents semi-random initial views, default: disabled).
 - Add keybinding options for free move keys (escape cancels keybinding).

v1.16.4
 - Recompiled with KSP 1.12 assemblies.

v1.16.3
Bugfixes:
 - Fix potential NRE when enabling IVA mode.
 - Abort trying to enter IVA mode if it throws an exception.
 - Don't add atmospheric controllers to objects that already have one.

v1.16.2
Bugfixes:
 - Respect random mode when manually activating the camera.
 - Exit IVA mode more reliably to avoid broken flickering camera.
 - Performance optimisations to avoid GC allocations.

v1.16.1
Bugfixes:
 - Fix NRE when vessel is destroyed before switching to IVA mode.
 - Don't immediately re-enter IVA mode if manually switched out of it.

v1.16.0
Bugfixes:
 - Try to reacquire a dogfight target if reverted due to a null dogfight target and Auto-Enable for BDArmory is enabled.
 - Limit the type of vessels atmospheric audio gets added to to avoid saturating KSP's SoundManager channels unnecessarily.
 - Fix indexing bug in 'pathing mode' (note: the example path is still weird).
Improvements:
 - Add sliders for configuring chances of 'random mode'.
 - Add IVA view to 'random mode' (if the vessel has a cockpit, otherwise it counts as dogfight mode).
 - In 'random mode', use the stationary camera when switching to views of a target that is close to the ground or about to crash.
 - Improve the positioning of the stationary camera when switching to views of a target that is close to the ground or about to crash.
 - Recover better from something else stealing the camera parent.

v1.15.4
Bugfixes:
 - Exclude music volume levels from volumes based on distance from the camera.
Improvements:
 - Migrate non-static config files to PluginData to avoid invalidating the ModuleManager cache (should give slightly faster start-up times).

v1.15.3
Bugfixes:
 - Disable slider discretisation when keypad control is enabled.
 - Properly correct for time-warp under almost all conditions for dogfight mode. (It only gets the offset wrong between 70km and 100km above Kerbin and similarly on other bodies.)
 - Eliminate pretty much all graphical glitches caused by floating origin and Krakensbane velocity shifts in dogfight mode.
Improvements:
 - Change the keypad move/zoom speeds to sliders for easier access.
 - Add option to turn on lots of debugging.

v1.15.2
Bugfixes:
 - Don't touch the camera when we're not in control of it!
 - Use TimeWarp times instead of Time times for velocity calculations.
Improvements:
 - Allow switching into and out of IVA and Map modes.

v1.15.1
Bugfixes:
 - Fix missing config file load/save bug.
